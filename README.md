# XBEE_Star_Topology_Communication

I joined a team to participate an international CanSat competition in 2021.
The exclusive mission was creating a communication network between 3 payload.
One of the payload was container which is in charge of collecting the other payloads' telemetry and fusing with own data and sending to ground station.
The other payloads are in container in the first stage. They have passive descend system. They separate from container when it's necessary and send telemetry to container until landing.
Container assigned as "Coordinator" and the other payloads assigned as "End Point" at XCTU program.

Due to pandemics, the competition never done.
